MobileProfilerAndroid
=====================

This is a part of my BTP - a mobile Profiler.

Note: For the large DB file, you might have to change your git client's settings to allow large HTTPS requests.

#### Instructions to set up the android project:
* Download the project template folder from http://goo.gl/M4RKtL.
* Extract the contents of the archive. The extracted folder will serve as your project folder.
* Do a git init and set up your git remote in that folder. 
* Use a git pull to get the code.
* To work with this project, just open ADT and import this folder as a project.
